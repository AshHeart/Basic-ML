# Basic-ML
A basic starter kit into Machine Learning using Python

## DIY

Download this repo to your local pc or clone it using git
From your terminal run:

```git clone https://github.com/AshHeart/Basic-ML.git```

Then `cd` into the folder by

```cd Basic-ML```

And you're good to go.

## Execution

To execute the code you'll need Python 3 or later on your machine and a few libraries,
  * TensforFlow, install it by running
    ```sudo pip install tensorflow```
  from your terminal.

  * SciKitLearn, install it by running
    ```sudo pip install -U scikit-learn```
    
  * NumPy, install it by running
    ```sudo pip install numpy```

## Steps
### Inside the src folder you'll find the actual code

### Start at the start_here folder
 You'll need Scikit-Learn and Numy for this one
 
### The second_step folder is the next one you want
 For this one you'll have to install graphviz 
  ```sudo pip install graphviz```
