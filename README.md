# Basic-ML
A basic starter kit into Machine Learning using Python

## DIY

Download this repo to your local pc or clone it using git
From your terminal run:

```git clone https://github.com/AshHeart/Basic-ML.git```

Then `cd` into the folder by

```cd Basic-ML```

And you're good to go.

Once you have this repo downloaded just do a

```git pull```

From the repo's directory to get the latest code.

## Execution

To execute the code you'll need Python 3 or later on your machine and a few libraries,
  * TensforFlow, install it by running
    ```sudo pip install tensorflow```
  from your terminal.

  * SciKitLearn, install it by running
    ```sudo pip install -U scikit-learn```

  * NumPy, install it by running
    ```sudo pip install numpy```

To learn more about these tools click these links:
[Tensor Flow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and
[Scikit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html).

## Steps
### Inside the src folder you'll find the actual code

### Start at the start_here folder
 You'll need Scikit-Learn and Numy for this one.

### The second_step folder is the next one you want
 For this one you'll have to install graphviz
  ```sudo pip install graphviz```

  To render the tree as a pdf file.

  You can read more about how we render the graph
  [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree).

### Third is selecting_features
  For this one we use matplot lib
  ```sudo pip install matplotlib```

  Read about this great tool [here](https://matplotlib.org/).

### Next is the pipelines folder
  Here we learn to use different classifiers and comapre their results.

  Checkout [Tensorflow Playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org/) to really visualize how classifiers work,
  and don't worry, you can't break it.

### We write our own classifier in scrappy_knn
  This really gets our machine learning into high gear, it's all smooh sailing from here on if you can understand this one.

  Here we use scipy ```sudo pip install scipy```

  You can read more about scipy [here](https://www.scipy.org/).
